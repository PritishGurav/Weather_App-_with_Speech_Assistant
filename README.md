<h2>🌈 Overview</h2>

<p>
It all started with a simple daily moment — standing at the door, staring at the sky, wondering:<br>
<i>“Will it rain today? Should I carry an umbrella?”</i><br><br>
Most weather apps answer that question with charts and numbers, but I imagined something more —
a companion that could <b>talk</b>, guide me, and make the experience warm and human.
</p>

<p>
That thought led to the creation of my <b>Weather App with Speech Assistant</b> —  
a Python desktop application that blends <b>real-time weather data</b> with <b>voice interaction</b>.  
Built using <b>Tkinter</b>, connected to <b>OpenWeatherMap API</b>, and paired with <b>pyttsx3</b>,  
the app doesn’t just report weather — <b>it speaks to you like a friendly assistant.</b>

<h2>📖 The Story Behind It</h2>

<p>
One morning, skies looked calm — yet minutes later, heavy rain poured suddenly.  
No warnings… no clues… and I was completely unprepared.<br><br>

That moment sparked an idea:<br>
<i>“What if checking the weather felt less technical… more like talking to a helpful friend?”</i><br><br>

I started building — piece by piece.  
A window to select cities, a button to fetch data, and soon, a voice greeting users and telling them exactly what the sky was planning.  
Suddenly, weather updates felt more alive — something you could <b>feel</b> rather than just read.
</p>

<p>
This project became more than a utility.  
It bridged <b>data and emotion</b> — turning raw information into a simple, human conversation.

<h2>🌤️ Why I Built This</h2>

<p>
I wanted to make weather checks feel personal and intuitive — something that isn’t just seen but experienced.  
With APIs, automation, and voice output working together, the app becomes more than a screen —  
it becomes a companion that talks to you, guides you, and prepares you for the day.
</p>

<p>
This project taught me that data isn’t only about numbers —  
<b>it can speak, connect, and tell stories.</b>
